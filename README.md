# Introduction
In the past year, a deadly virus has taken over the entire United States. The government has failed to give us the information we all need and as a consequence, many people have denied that it's even happening. If left unchecked, the consequences could be disastrous. I'm talking, of course, about UFO fever.

That's right, with the official Pentagon report on UFO's right around the corner, and the hype building, I think it's an appropriate time to examine one of the oldest and largest collections of UFO reports on the internet: the National UFO Reporting Center database.

So let's go for the biggest question of all: What are all these lights in the sky? Can we truly attribute all sightings to tricks of the light, man made aircraft, and oddly shaped clouds? Or are we in the midst of an interplanetary invasion?
